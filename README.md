# Credit_Risk_Analysis
 
# Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to see which resampling method and machine learning model is the most accurate for determining credit risk. This is done using oversampling, undersampling, and a combinational approach all with the logistic regression model. Next we use two different machine learning models that reduce bias.
